# FRC Team 4593 - Rapid Acceleration
Welcome to the official GitHub organization for First Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 4593, Rapid Acceleration. We are a group of high school students who are passionate about engineering, programming, and teamwork. Every year we design, build, and code a robot to compete in the year's FIRST Robotics Competition challenge. This is where you'll find all our past and current robot code.

## Team History & Mission
Team Mission Statement: "To provide an inspiring environment that fosters growth and appreciation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields and business management through a strong relationship between mentors, students, and sponsors."

We are FIRST Robotics Team Rapid Acceleration 4593, based in Rapid City, South Dakota. Our robotics team consists of high school students from around the area. Our program was established in 2013, with the help of our long-standing sponsor, Caterpillar. We started with the purpose of giving students the opportunity to participate in fun Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) -oriented projects.

In South Dakota, we are the only organization that has met the challenge to offer this program, which is something that we are working hard to change. We strive to encourage students to participate in activities that relate to careers in STEM, such as engineering, computer science, CAD, and graphic design, with the hope of growing great future employees. We encourage students to give back to the community through volunteering and outreach programs, such as teaching robotics to elementary students, feeding the hungry, and community clean-up. We believe that if you can reach youth at an early age, you can install life-long values that benefit the world.
